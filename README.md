# School_District_Analysis
## Overview
Maria, the chief data scientist for City School, is responsible for collecting data on City Schools testing proficiency. She provided us `.csv` files with the students' test scores, school-related information and funding. Using Pandas, we will be analyzing this data and presenting it to the school board. This will help them with making decisions regarding school budgets and priorities.

Maria was notified by the school board that the `students_complete.csv` file contains academic dishonesty for math and reading grades for some students. She would appreciate if we replace the math and reading scores for Thomas High School with NaNs. With that, she would also like for us to re-do the school district analysis and write a report explaining how these changes affected our analysis.
